# dev-test-api

Part 1: UI Test - 30 minutes
Replicate the UI from this page: https://dev-test-api.vercel.app/

You can use Google, Stackoverflow, and any NPM packages.

It might look simple, but go beyond the look and focus on the finer details (what happens when you hover, or when you drag a file into the upload box, once the file is dropped, etc.). The file upload only accepts image files.

Part 2: API Test - 30 minutes

Complete the API that uploads the file to a storage on Firebase. (The API is under /pages/api/file-upload.js).

Upload the file strictly on the server side (parse the API request and funnel it into Firebase storage), not on the client side.

Clue: The repo is missing one essential NPM package
